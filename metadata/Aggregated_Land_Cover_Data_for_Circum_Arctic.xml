Percent tree canopy cover was mapped using the MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields Collection 5.1 data product (MOD44B; Hansen et al 2003). We combined the 19 original GLC2000 land cover classes present in the study region into six aggregate classes for analysis. Aggregation of the land cover classes was informed by preliminary assessment of the spatial extent, percent canopy cover, other regional land cover products (Walker et al 2005, Sulla-Menashe et al 2011), and overall relevance to the study.</para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para>Needleleaf deciduous and needleleaf evergreen classes were retained due to their extent and importance in the region, and all broadleaf or mixed leaf classes and burned forests were aggregated to an other forest class. These classes were aggregated because of their relatively small areal extents, and in the case of burned forests the dominant pre-fire vegetation type could not be determined.</para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para>Mosaic forest and evergreen shrub were aggregated to the mosaic forest class. Evergreen shrub was included in this class because the two original classes were found in close proximity near latitudinal treeline, and because the dominant shrub species in these systems are deciduous (e.g. Walker et al 2005). Moreover, the GLC2000 criteria for forest height is a minimum of 5 m, and it is likely that the evergreen shrub class consists of open woodlands with short slow-growing trees, and analysis of MODIS VCF data showed the evergreen shrub class to have a mean canopy cover of 16% (table 1), which is higher than the original mosaic forest class, and on par with needleleaf deciduous forests in the continuous permafrost zone. The remaining shrub and herbaceous classes were aggregated into the tundra class.</para></description></methodStep><methodStep><description><para>Lastly, all non-vegetated classes that included any sort of management were aggregated into the other class.</para></description></methodStep><sampling><studyExtent><description><para>The spatial domain for this study was defined using the Circum-Arctic Map of Permafrost and Ground Ice Conditions (CAMP; Brown et al 1998). This map covers the northern hemisphere poleward of 20° N latitude, and categorizes permafrost affected areas as continuous (90%–100% areal cover), discontinuous (50%–90% areal cover), sporadic (10%–50% areal cover), and intermittent (&#x3C;10% areal cover) permafrost zones. Our analyses were restricted to the continuous and discontinuous permafrost zones to avoid including large areas unaffected by permafrost. Because one of our aims was to quantify the amount of permafrost soil carbon underlying areas affected by fire and vegetation change within different ecosystems we further restricted our study area using the Northern Circumpolar Soil Carbon Database v2 (NCSCD; Hugelius et al 2013). This effectively removed altitudinal permafrost at lower latitudes (i.e. in the Alps and Himalayan mountain ranges). The final study domain included approximately 11 million km2 underlain by continuous permafrost and 3.5 million km2 with discontinuous permafrost (figure 1, table 1).</para></description></studyExtent><samplingDescription><para>No sampling description provided.</para></samplingDescription></sampling></methods><project><title>Aggregated Land Cover Data for Circum-Arctic Permafrost Zones (2000)</title><personnel id="3130618278828614"><individualName><givenName>Samantha</givenName><surName>Csik</surName></individualName><organizationName>NCEAS</organizationName><positionName>Arctic Data Fellow</positionName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel id="8833118161591602"><individualName><givenName>Michael</givenName><surName>Loranty</surName></individualName><organizationName>Department of Geography, Colgate University</organizationName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><personnel id="8812724521847106"><individualName><givenName>Wil</givenName><surName>Lieberman-Cribbin</surName></individualName><organizationName>Department of Forest Ecosystems and Society, Oregon State University</organizationName><role>principalInvestigator</role></personnel><funding><para>1623764</para><para>1304040</para><para>1304464</para><para>1417700</para><para>1417908</para><para>1417745</para></funding></project><otherEntity id="urn-uuid-9e7a76a5-a8a0-4cb4-852f-f45cbb8550f7"><entityName>Exercise1_reformatted_table.csv</entityName><entityType>text/csv</entityType></otherEntity></dataset></eml:eml>
